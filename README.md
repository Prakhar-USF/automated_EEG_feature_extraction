## Abstract:

Researchers using Electroencephalograms (“EEGs”) in order to diagnose clinical outcomes often run into computational complexity problems. In particular, extracting complex, sometimes non-linear, features from a large number of time series can take large amounts of time. In this project we create a system which uses cloud-based technologies to demonstrate that such tools can increase the efficiency of computation.
